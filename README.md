## Description
Welcome aboard our project - a unique website for purchasing trips to Mars! This project embodies the dream of interplanetary travel, offering users the opportunity to "purchase" a trip to the Red Planet right from the comfort of their home.

## Functionality
The project is a landing page with the ability to register and make a "fake" purchase of a ticket to Mars. Users can choose the comfort level of their journey, making the process more interactive and personalized.

In addition, the project has a separate admin panel. Access to it can be obtained using the following credentials:

In this panel, the administrator can manage existing users, trip-levels, and other aspects of the site.

## Installation
No installation is required to use this project. Just go to the website and start your virtual journey to Mars!
